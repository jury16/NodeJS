Create a page with an arbitrary form (`<form method = get>` tag).

Don't use any JavaScript or AJAX.
Form validation - server only.

In case of successful validation, display the data received from the form in any form.
In case of a validation error, issue an error message and display the same form with the previously entered data.

<h5>index.html - file in local storage or on the Internet page<br>
webserver.js - file on server</h5>
